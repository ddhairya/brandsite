# Background
A react site for a brand [BareBurger](https://ddhairya.github.io/brandsite/) build with PHP as backend and MySQL as DB. Have integrated google analytic to gather the customer behavior for making decision. Mainly bootstrap is been used for styling and used flex box, custom grid concept for fluid responsive site. Gathering realtime customer feedback and also Ticketing system for raising internal maintenance request.

## Technologies & Libraries
1.  react-router-dom - For routing the pages without reloading.

3.  ga - Google Analytic to track the customer behavior
4.  PHP as backend
5.  PHPMailer - For sending the mail notification
6.  Google Font - For Font
7.  Bootstrap - For styling
8.  styled-components - For inline styling.

## Walk Through
Started with lots of different animation effect and ended with simple and elegant minimal animation to meet the needs. 
A simple liftover intro page and a left to right slider for each section ans services.

## Complexity
Biggest challenge was the first load time. Traffic was directly from the customer so it was mandatory to load the site in less than 3 second. 
Once the site was live, there was a new requirement to add a ticketing system for internal usage.

## Solution
we did achieve by optimizing the code, style and  asynchronous calls. Following the Agile methodology and deep understanding of domain we got the solution.
